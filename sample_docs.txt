LangChain Framework Overview

LangChain is a powerful framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides several key components that make it easier to build AI applications.

Key Components:
1. LLMs (Large Language Models) - The core AI models that understand and generate text
2. Prompt Templates - Reusable templates for structuring inputs to language models
3. Chains - Sequences of calls to LLMs or other utilities
4. Agents - LLMs that can decide which actions to take and use tools
5. Memory - Components that maintain state between calls
6. Vector Stores - Databases optimized for similarity search

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems can access and incorporate relevant information from external documents or databases.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Ingestion - External documents are processed and split into chunks
2. Embedding Creation - Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings
3. Vector Storage - Embeddings are stored in a vector database
4. Query Processing - User queries are converted to embeddings
5. Similarity Search - Relevant document chunks are retrieved
6. Context Integration - Retrieved information is added to the LLM prompt
7. Response Generation - The LLM generates answers using both its knowledge and retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Access to up-to-date information
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Reduced hallucinations
- Transparent information sources
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
